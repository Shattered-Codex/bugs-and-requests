# Bugs and Requests

Use this guide to open issues with consistent detail.

## Title format
- Always use `[Module-Name][bug|request|improvement] - Title`.
- `Module-Name`: component or service the issue touches (e.g., `payments-service`).
- `bug|request|improvement`: choose one type to match the work needed.
- `Title`: short, action-oriented description (avoid internal acronyms).

## How to open an issue
1. Open the repository Issues tab and click `New issue`.
2. Pick the **Bug / Request / Improvement** template.
3. Set the issue title to match `[Module-Name][bug|request|improvement] - Title`.
4. Fill in every template section:
   - **Summary**: 1–2 sentences on what is needed.
   - **Module**: exact module or area affected.
   - **Type**: bug, request, or improvement.
   - **Priority**: Low, Medium, or High.
   - **Environment**: where the issue appears (e.g., prod, staging).
   - **Steps to Reproduce**: numbered steps if reporting a bug.
   - **Expected Result** vs. **Current Result**: what should happen and what happens now.
   - **Additional Context**: logs, screenshots, links, or related tickets.
5. Submit the issue and tag relevant owners or teams if needed.

## Notes
- One issue per concern; do not mix unrelated bugs or requests.
- Add screenshots or logs when they help others reproduce or understand impact.
